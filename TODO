add support for using tags to specify the default values of optional fields
	- required fields should probably *not* allow "default"
	tag since that seems to be a conflicting spec

add support for validation functions that can return an error in addition to the
normal validation result (boolean)
	- for example, this can help with a function that checks email-uniqueness but
	fails due to db-connection / invalid-sql errors rather than because the email
	is already taken...
