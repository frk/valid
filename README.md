# valid

The package `valid` defines a number of validation functions and other objects that can
be used, together with the [`cmd/validgen`](cmd/validgen) tool, to generate static input validation.

--------

Some (most) validators, including their tests & comments, were ported from https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js
